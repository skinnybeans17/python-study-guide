            <p>A standard library is the set of tools included in a language's standard installation. The library includes core data structures and tools for working with data in your program.</p>

            <p>Python's standard library includes tools to help you work with a variety of data types and text, work with files and times and dates, use mathematical functions, make graphical user interfaces (GUIs), work with multimedia and networks, distribute your programs, and test and debug your code and handle errors.</p>

            <p>Standard library usually doesn't include specialized data analysis tools, web application frameworks, game frameworks, and other application-specific libraries. These are available through external libraries that are updated more usually than the language as a whole. Once you understand a language's core rules and syntax, become familiar with the language's standard library tools as these can help you write code efficiently.</p>
