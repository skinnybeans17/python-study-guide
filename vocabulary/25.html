          <div class="card-body">
            <p>A mapping is a data structure that connects two more pieces of information, commonly called a key-value pair. When a key is asked, you get its associated value. One mapping structure can store multiple key-value pairs.</p>

            <h4 class="my-0 fw-normal">Why are mappings important?</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Mappings don't just store data. They allow you to establish relationships between the data. For example, you could pair a password with each username, a capital with each country, and an author with each book.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Mappings aren't limited to single pieces of data: you could use a single piece of data as a key and a sequence as the value. For example, you could pair a username with a sequnce of other users to define a relationship between one user and other users. This is the core of how many different social networks are implemented.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>In Python, the main mapping type is the dictionary. Make sure dictionaries are understandable to you, because many advanced Python data structures are represented by them.</p>
