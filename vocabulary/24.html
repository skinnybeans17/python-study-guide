            <p>A sequence is a data structure which stores an items collection in a particular order. In some languages, a sequence can only contain one type of items; in other languages, including Python, a sequence can have different types of items.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Sequences are important when you need to store items in a particular order. For example, a list of website users might be ordered according to when each user signed up.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p>With a sequence, you can add or remove items, work with individual or groups of items, determine whether a value is in the sequence, look for unique or duplicate items, loop through the sequence and do something with each item, and work with items that math particular conditions.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p>In Python, the main sequence type is the list, which are mutable. There are also tuples, which are immutable sequences, meaning that they can't be changed after being defined. Strings are a special type of sequence, as each element is a character in the sequence.</p>
