# python-study-guide

This project that I made is a study guide website that's related to Python. In particular, Python and the definitions and concepts that are related to it that's important to know about. This website has a total of 33 different topics, and around three or four different questions and answers related to each of the topics that you can find on each of the pages for each topic.

## How this site is used

First, you will go on the website, and then you'll see 33 different topics on the main page. Each topic has it's own page, and you can go to each of those pages by clicking on the 'Learn More' button underneath each of the topic. There, you will see questions related to each of the topics, around three or four, sometimes five, for the topic as well as answers to each of the questions as well. This website is to be used as a study guide for people who don't know much about Python or want to learn more about it to have a better understanding of it and each of the concepts related to it as well, and for helping people who had trouble with Python before, to help understand it better too.

## Inspiration for website

I wanted to make this website because of me learning about coding for almost a half-decade (five years) now. In particular, I wanted to base this site around Python and the concepts around it that I was learning about during my first semester here at college and a little bit before that in weekly classes I took before I came to Make School. During the break, I bought some flash cards related to Python, and reading those flash cards gave me an idea to base those cards around those subjects in the cards. The flash card set I based this website around included nine different topics, with a total of 101 cards, and I decided to base this around one section in the cards, which is the first set, which contains a total of 33 flash cards related to concepts and vocabulary, due to that section having the most amount of cards in the set, and I feel like those things are the easiest to talk about for things related to Python, since it gives a good grasp about what Python is all about.
